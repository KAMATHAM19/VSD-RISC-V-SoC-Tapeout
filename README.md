# VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program
Hands-on SoC design journey from RTL to GDSII using open-source EDA. Part of the VSD RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program, covering RTL simulation, synthesis, gate level simulation (GLS), STA, floorplan, placement, routing, and timing closure â€” building a unique RISC-V SoC ready for tapeout

## Program Objective  

- Learn **end-to-end RISC-V SoC design and tapeout flow** using open-source EDA tools.  
- Explore **RTL design, simulation, synthesis, STA, and physical design** concepts.  
- Gain hands-on exposure to **GLS, PnR, timing closure, and sign-off** practices.  
- Apply knowledge in a **structured week-by-week learning plan** (from **spec â†’ GDSII**).  
- Build a **unique reference SoC project**, documented for **reproducibility and tapeout readiness**.
